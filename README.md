# LeetCode Team 2 Solutions Repository

Welcome to our team repository for solving various LeetCode problems using Python, Java, and TypeScript. The objective of this project is to collaboratively work on and solve a set of problems in different programming languages. Each solution will be submitted in a pull request (PR), with different files for each problem.

## Problems Solved

Our team has solved the following LeetCode problems:

1. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III**
2. **Patching Array**
3. **Department Top Three Salaries** (SQL)
4. **Shortest Palindrome**

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language and each programming language contains a folder with files for each problem's solution. Here's the structure for each language:

```
/LeetCode-Team-Solutions
    /TypeScript
        - Problem1.ts
        - Problem2.ts
        - Problem3.ts
    /Java
        - Problem1.java
        - Problem2.java
        - Problem3.java
    /Python
        - Problem1.py
        - Problem2.py
        - Problem3.py
    /SQL
        - Problem1.sql  # SQL solution for Department Top Three Salaries
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Each problem is placed in its respective file.
- A single PR per language is created containing the solutions for all problems for that language.

## Problem Descriptions

### 1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

This problem asks you to find the maximum profit you can achieve by completing at most two transactions (buy and sell).

### 2. Patching Array

In this problem, you are given a sorted array of positive integers, and you need to find the least number of patches needed to make every number from `1` to `n` (inclusive) constructible by summing up elements of the array.

### 3. Department Top Three Salaries (SQL)

Given a table of employee information, write an SQL query to return the top three salaries from each department. The query should return the highest salary, second-highest, and third-highest salary for each department.

### 4. Shortest Palindrome

Given a string, you need to find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters at the front of the string.
